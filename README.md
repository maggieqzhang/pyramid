# Rumen
## Group Ordering Made Easy
Rumen is a web platform where neighbors and friends can group order restaurant takeout. With Rumen, we're reinventing Covid-era restaurant takeout services with communal pickups and bulk orders. Eat with friends or meet new ones! 

### The Problem
1. Safety is one of the main concerns of eating at a restaurant due to limited outdoor seating and fears of COVID-19
2. Huge delivery fees associated with ordering with mobile dining apps such as Uber Eats
3. People still crave social contact with friends and enjoy a change of scenery

### Why Rumen is the solution
- With contactless delivery in public spaces, we ensure the safety of consumers.
- By ordering in bulk, we decrease delivery prices
- Allowing for pickups at parks, we create a safe way to eat out with friends in public spaces.

### Project Implementation
#### Technologies Used
- Front End: React, HTML/CSS/JS
- Back End: Python/Flask
- Database: MongoDB
- API Testing: Postman
- Hosting: Netlify

#### Looking Ahead
1. Changing our business model from a flat fee
2. Merging the back-end code with the front-end
3. Adding in the Restaurant-side UI by merging Google Restaurant API
4. Expanding not only to globally known restaurants, but focusing on local food where take-out services are more limited/difficult
